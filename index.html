        <p>Something I put together last year and manually updated (with a lot of copy/pasting of spreadsheets) - this year thanks to access to some data, and some scripting I've gone <i>automagic!</i> so for a bit of fun, you can compare to what TdF rider you're potentially channeling on a given stage and across the tour. This is <b>clearly</b> not an official Chasing Tour resource - for that you'll want to visit the <a href="https://chasingtour.com/">Chasing Tour</a>site for details or <a href="https://discord.gg/9UZZjMGfYH">the Chasing Racing Discord</a> for bantz.
